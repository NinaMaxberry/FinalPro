<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
<p1>The Children's Rainbow Project is a continuation of a non-profit youth foundation started in Manassas Park, Virginia in 2005. YES YOU CAN! YOUNG LADY! YOUNG MAN! was a nonprofit foundation established by Hosea Mills.  The foundation was dedicated to mentoring youth from the ages of 7 to 17. Shortly after establishing the foundation, Mr. Mills selected Nina Maxberry as the foundations Executive Director.  Together they defined the foundations mission as not specific to race or religion, but instead the opportunity to build positive self-confidence, job skills and literacy in the younger generation. </p1><br>
  
<p1>Programs include a Life Cycle program that develops skills in financial planning, career building and personal development, along with a community service program for juveniles with legal obligations, and counseling programs for substance abuse, incarceration and gang affiliation. </p1><br>

<p1>We invite you to visit our <span><a href="programs.html">Program</a></span> page and discover the area you would like more information.  Of course, your interest in helping is always appreciated. </p1>
