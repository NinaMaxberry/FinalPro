# RainbowProjec
This is my first website set up through Code Louisville.
As I have matriculated through the program, I see the upgrades that are needed/required but decided to show you my initial project.
Does it show my passion, absolutely!  Not for just this website but my commitment to being a part of "digging, discovering, coding and making "life better for clients and All!"
This is a web site showcasing a youth foundation.
It consists of four pages: Home/About; Programs/ Volunteer/Donate and Contact US pages.
Home/About Us: uses Medida Query for small screes to change navbar and two columns.
Program: offers the user to hover over program modules with additional information
Volunteer/Donate: is a form allowing the user to offer hands on volunteering or a donation.  Once the customer completes the customer contact information and clicks on submit an alert will pop up thanking them with their first name.
Contact Us: the user can click on the email button which will open up a email dialog box populated with the foundations email information.
I am working on a carosel that will rotate on all pages as a vistor vists a page within the website.
